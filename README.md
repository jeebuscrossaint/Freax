# Freax
*since linux was originally going to be called Freax, I may as well do it myself*

# how to run
idk like use whatever package manager u use install qemu-system-riscv32 and probably opensbi seeing as thats like the bios
then run `make run` and it should work

oh yea i use llvm tools so u gonna want like the llvm suite of tools installed and clang and of course make sure it supports riscv
you can check by running clang --print-targets  and in the list there should be riscv if not then ur outta luck

yea thats about it bruh
